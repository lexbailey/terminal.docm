# A terminal emulator that is a Word document

This is a terminal emulator. It is also a Word document.

## Platform support

Specficially only Windows 11 or 10 with "Microsoft Word for Microsoft 365"

Earlier windows versions will not work. (Vista and XP certainly won't work, 8 is a long shot)

(I've only tested this on Windows 11, but a friend with Windows 10 informs me that it does work there too)

## Installation

Download terminal.docm

## Usage

1. Open terminal.docm in Microsoft Word
2. Enable macros
3. Enable the quick access toolbar, if not already enabled.
4. Click on either "bash" or "CMD" according to your needs.

You can now use the terminal by typing into the document. Most normal terminal behaviours work, but not all.

## Why?

Entertainment.

## IMPORTANT CAVEATS

When the terminal is running, it will spin at max CPU usage. Please do not accidentally leave it running. Remember to click "Stop shell" when you are done. (or just close Word)

## Pull requests

Sure, if you like. I'll accept little fixes if people want to fix things, but I won't accept anything that significantly changes things or adds large new features, since I don't want to spend time maintaining this, it is a throw away joke.
